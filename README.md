# AI-CMO

Your AI marketing strategist. Clone it, open it in Claude Code, start talking.

AI-CMO is a strategic marketing advisor that manages content strategy, planning, and performance tracking across multiple clients. It directs strategy — it doesn't create final content. You get data-driven content plans, brand voice guidelines, performance tracking, and an operational memory that gets smarter over time.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Midnight-Farmer/ai-cmo.git
cd ai-cmo
```

Open the folder in [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) (CLI, desktop app, or IDE extension). Then just say:

```
new client my-business
```

This runs a guided ~20 minute interview that builds your complete marketing profile. You'll leave with your first monthly and weekly content plans ready to execute.

**Requirements:** Claude Code with a Claude Pro or Max plan.

## How It Works

AI-CMO is conversational, not transactional. You don't need to memorize commands or invoke workflows in a specific order. Just talk to it like a colleague:

- "What should we post this week?"
- "How are we doing on Instagram?"
- "I just got back from a shoot, footage is on the drive"
- "The kitchen project is done — we need a reveal post"

The agent recognizes what you're saying, reads the right knowledge files, runs the right workflows, and suggests the next step. Workflows chain naturally — a shoot leads to organizing, which leads to a content review, which leads to editing priorities.

## What You Get After Setup

- **Brand voice guidelines** extracted from your actual writing
- **Customer personas** using the StoryBrand framework
- **Monthly content strategies** with 4-week breakdowns and experiments
- **Bi-weekly execution plans** with performance data pulls and platform research
- **Weekly content plans** with hooks, scripts, shot lists, and caption direction
- **Performance tracking** that feeds back into smarter plans
- **Operational memory** that persists decisions and context across sessions
- **Content asset index** tracking footage across any number of storage locations

## Available Workflows

These are available as slash commands and as natural language triggers:

| What You Say | What Happens |
|-------------|-------------|
| "brief me on [client]" | Structured strategy summary + conversational Q&A |
| "monthly plan for [client]" | Month-level strategy with weekly themes |
| "biweekly plan for [client]" | Two-week execution plan with performance data |
| "weekly plan for [client]" | Specific content pieces with scripts and captions |
| "analyze performance" | Pattern identification from tracking data |
| "update whats working" | Refresh performance insights |
| "I just got back from a shoot" | Process and organize footage, then review for content ideas |
| "where's the footage for [project]?" | Check the content asset index |
| "new client [name]" | Guided onboarding interview |
| "update strategy" | Change goals, voice, content mix, or other strategy elements |
| "log content / performance / lead" | Quick data entry |

## Reference Library

In addition to the core workflows, AI-CMO includes specialized marketing knowledge that it pulls from when relevant:

| Reference | What's In It |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Marketing Psychology** | 70+ mental models for hooks, CTAs, messaging, and pricing |
| **Content Strategy** | Topic clusters, buyer journey mapping, content prioritization |
| **Email Sequences** | Drip campaigns, lifecycle automation, copy guidelines |
| **SEO Audit** | 7-dimension technical SEO audit framework |
| **Analytics Tracking** | GA4, GTM, event tracking, UTM frameworks |

## Client Folder Structure

Each client gets an isolated folder:

```
clients/your-client/
├── .claude/CLAUDE.md         # Client-specific instructions and context
├── knowledge/                # Strategy documents (voice, personas, goals, what's working)
├── tracking/                 # CSVs and content indexes
├── content/                  # Published content + competitors
├── transcripts/              # Call recordings, interviews
├── memory/                   # Operational memory across sessions
│   ├── MEMORY.md             # Curated summaries
│   └── logs/                 # Daily session logs
└── outputs/                  # Generated plans, briefs, and content notes
```

Client data stays local — it's never tracked by git.

## Weekly Workflow

| When | What | Time |
|------|------|------|
| Monday | Log metrics, generate weekly plan | 30-45 min |
| Tue-Thu | Create and publish content | Your pace |
| Friday | Log content, quick metrics check | 15 min |
| Monthly | Review performance, generate next month's strategy | 30 min |

## Optional Integrations

| Integration | What It Does |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Typefully** | Draft social posts for X + LinkedIn |
| **Google Drive/Sheets/Docs** | Collaborative tracking and deliverables |
| **GA4 / Search Console** | Website analytics and search data |
| **HubSpot** | CRM and lead pipeline management |

All integrations are optional. The system works fully with local markdown and CSV files.

## Recommended: Humanizer

AI-CMO directs strategy — when you need Claude to write or polish copy, pair it with [Humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer). It strips common AI writing patterns so your captions and scripts sound like a person wrote them.
