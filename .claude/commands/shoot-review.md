# Post-Shoot Review

Run this **after** `/organize-shoot` has processed a shoot folder. It bridges the gap between raw organized footage and the content pipeline:

1. Updates existing content notes with actual file locations
2. Flags planned content that wasn't captured
3. Surfaces unplanned footage and suggests new content ideas
4. Creates new ad-hoc content notes for anything the user approves

## Arguments

User provided: $ARGUMENTS

Parse for:
- **Path** to the processed shoot folder (the same folder that was passed to `/organize-shoot`)

If no path provided, ask:
1. "Where is the processed shoot folder? (full path — same one you ran /organize-shoot on)"

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Organize-Shoot Output

Read the master file-mapping from the shoot folder:

```bash
cat "[shoot-folder]/file-mapping.csv"
```

If no `file-mapping.csv` exists at root, look for per-location `file-mapping.txt` files:

```bash
find "[shoot-folder]" -name "file-mapping.txt" -maxdepth 2
```

From the file-mapping, build a list of **all named content pieces**:
- **A-Roll** — files starting with `ARoll-` (or legacy `Post[N]-`). Extract: location, description, duration, transcript summary.
- **Content Bank** — files starting with `CB-`. Extract: location, description, duration, transcript summary.
- **Named B-Roll** — files starting with `BRoll-`. Extract: location, description.
- **Unmatched with speech** — files with transcripts that weren't classified. These are the most interesting for new content ideas.

Also read transcripts from the `Audio/` subfolders — particularly for files that weren't confidently named. The raw transcript text is the richest source for content ideas.

### Step 2: Read the Current Bi-Weekly Brief

Find the most recent biweekly brief:
```
clients/[client]/outputs/biweekly-briefs/
```

Extract:
- Planned content pieces (titles, formats, projects)
- Shot list (what was supposed to be captured)
- Content bank items (shot from previous shoots, planned for this cycle)

### Step 3: Read All Matching Content Notes

Scan `outputs/content/` for content notes that match the projects in this shoot:

```bash
grep -l "project: \"[ProjectName]\"" outputs/content/*.md
```

Also check for content notes whose `shoot_date` matches this shoot's date.

For each matching note, read:
- `content_id`, `title`, `status`, `source_footage`, `project`, `shoot_date`
- The shot list section (to check what was planned)

### Step 4: Match Footage → Content Notes

For each A-Roll and CB piece from the file-mapping:

1. **Find the matching content note** by cross-referencing:
   - Project name in the filename → `project` field in frontmatter
   - Description keywords → `title` or concept text
   - If ambiguous, use the transcript summary to disambiguate

2. **Update the content note:**
   - Set `source_footage` to the renamed filename (e.g., `ARoll-Henderson-Kitchen-Walkthrough.MP4`)
   - Set `status: captured` (only if currently `concept` or `pre-production`)
   - Set `shoot_date` to the actual shoot date (if different from planned)
   - Check off matching items in the `## Shot List` section
   - Append to `## Revision History`:
     ```
     YYYY-MM-DD: Status → captured (shoot-review). Source: [filename] ([duration]s)
     ```

3. **Track what was matched** for the summary in Step 6.

### Step 5: Flag Planned but NOT Captured

For content notes that:
- Match a project that was visited on this shoot day
- Have `status: concept` or `pre-production`
- Were NOT matched to any footage in Step 4

Append to their `## Revision History`:
```
YYYY-MM-DD: NOT CAPTURED on [shoot-date] shoot — needs rescheduling
```

Do NOT change their status — they stay as-is for the next shoot.

### Step 6: Identify Unplanned Footage (Bonus Content)

Compare the file-mapping against what was matched in Step 4. Anything that wasn't matched to an existing content note is **bonus footage**.

For each unplanned piece, extract:
- Filename and type (A-Roll, CB, named B-Roll)
- Location/project
- Duration
- Transcript summary (from the file-mapping.csv `transcript_summary` column or from the .txt transcript files)

Group bonus footage by project.

### Step 7: Present the Review

Show a structured summary to the user:

```markdown
## Shoot Review: [Shoot Date]

### Content Notes Updated
| Content Note | Status Change | Source File | Duration |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| [[note-filename]] | concept → captured | ARoll-Location-Desc.MP4 | 78s |

### Planned but NOT Captured
| Content Note | Project | Reason |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| [[note-filename]] | [Project] | Not shot on [date] |

### Bonus Footage (Not in Current Pipeline)
| # | Type | Project | File | Duration | What's In It |
|---|------|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | A-Roll | Waverly | ARoll-Waverly-Addition-Progress.MP4 | 65s | Owner walks the addition — framing complete, windows in, siding started |
| 2 | CB | Morrison | CB-Morrison-Crown-Molding-Detail.MP4 | 38s | "Crown molding is one of those things..." |
| 3 | B-Roll | Henderson | BRoll-Henderson-Ceiling-Beam.MP4 | 8s | Ceiling beam detail shot |

### Unmatched Clips with Speech
| File | Duration | Transcript Excerpt |
|------|----------|--------------------|
| 064A7350.MP4 | 22s | "So this is the issue with the flashing..." |
```

### Step 8: Suggest Content Ideas

For each bonus footage item (especially A-Roll and CB pieces), generate a content idea:

**For each suggestion, provide:**
- **Title** — concise name for the piece
- **Format** — Reel, Carousel, etc. (based on duration and content type)
- **Platform** — Instagram, Facebook, YouTube Shorts, TikTok
- **Why it works** — connect to `whats-working.md` patterns (e.g., "educational reels outperform phase updates," "content bank pieces with strong hooks hit 400+ reach")
- **Hook direction** — 1-2 sentence hook concept based on the transcript
- **One-line caption direction**

Read `knowledge/whats-working.md` before generating suggestions to ground them in actual performance data.

**Present ideas conversationally:**
> "You also captured a 38-second CB piece where the owner talks about crown molding shortcuts. Educational content bank pieces have been your strongest format. Want me to create a content note for this?"

### Step 9: Interactive Conversation

After presenting the review and suggestions, **ask the user what they want to do:**

> "Any of these bonus pieces you want to add to the content pipeline? I can create content notes for them right now. You can also tell me to skip all of them or adjust the ideas."

Wait for the user's response. They may:
- **Approve specific pieces** — "Yes, do 1 and 3"
- **Modify an idea** — "The crown molding one, but frame it as a mistakes-to-avoid piece"
- **Skip all** — "None of these, we're good"
- **Ask questions** — "What's the transcript on #2?" — read and share the full transcript

Continue the conversation until the user is done.

### Step 10: Create Ad-Hoc Content Notes

For each approved idea, create a content note in `outputs/content/`:

**Filename:** `YYYY-MM-DD-[PREFIX]-NN-slug.md`
- `YYYY-MM-DD` = target post date. If no brief cycle is active, use 7 days from today as a placeholder. Ask the user if they have a preferred date.
- `[PREFIX]` = client's prefix (e.g., `AB` for Acme Builders — check existing content notes for the pattern)
- `NN` = next available number (check existing files in `outputs/content/`)
- `slug` = lowercase hyphenated title

**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
content_id: "CP-YYYYMMDD-NN"
title: "[Title from approved idea]"
client: "[client-folder-name]"
brief: ""
status: captured
post_date: YYYY-MM-DD
platform:
  - Instagram
  - Facebook
format: "[Format]"
project: "[Project name]"
project_social_name: "[Social name]"
duration: "[Duration from footage]"
source_footage: "[Renamed filename from organize-shoot]"
shoot_date: [actual shoot date]
tags: [relevant tags]
---
```

**Key differences from brief-generated notes:**
- `brief: ""` — ad-hoc, not tied to a brief
- `status: captured` — footage already exists
- `source_footage` — already populated with the actual file

**Body sections to generate:**
- `## Concept` — why this content works, data backing from whats-working.md
- `## Script` — if A-roll, note the existing footage duration and key talking points from transcript. Direction for trimming/editing.
- `## Caption` — full draft caption following voice-guidelines.md and blog-voice-analysis.md
- `## Shot List` — all items checked (footage exists)
- `## Edit Notes` — text overlays, trim targets, music direction
- `## Revision History` — initial entry:
  ```
  YYYY-MM-DD: Created from shoot-review (ad-hoc). Source: [filename] ([duration]s)
  ```

Read `knowledge/voice-guidelines.md` and `knowledge/blog-voice-analysis.md` before writing captions.

### Step 11: Update Shoot Log

After all content notes are created/updated, update the shoot log entry for this shoot date in `tracking/shoot-log.md`:

- Add any new content pieces to the **Content Pieces** or **Content Bank** tables
- Update edit status for pieces that were matched to content notes
- Note any pieces the user chose to skip

---

## Notes

- **This command is read-heavy, write-light.** The bulk of the work is reading and cross-referencing. Only writes happen to content notes, and only with user approval for new ones.
- **Organize-shoot must run first.** This command depends on file-mapping.csv/txt, renamed files, and transcripts. If these don't exist, tell the user to run `/organize-shoot` first.
- **Named B-Roll typically doesn't get its own content note** — it's supplementary footage for A-Roll pieces. But if a B-Roll clip has an unusually interesting narration or captures something noteworthy, suggest it.
- **Transcripts are the gold mine.** The most interesting content ideas come from things the owner said off-the-cuff while being filmed — side explanations, reactions, teaching moments. Read the full transcripts for unmatched clips, not just the file-mapping summary.
- **Multiple projects per shoot are normal.** A single shoot day often covers 3-4 project sites. Group everything by project in the review.
- **Content bank pieces are the easiest wins.** They don't need a brief cycle, they're already shot, and educational CB pieces consistently outperform. Lean into suggesting these.
