## Integrations

The AI-CMO system can connect to external services. All are optional and configured per-client.

| Integration | What It Does | Setup Required |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Google Drive** | Store and organize deliverables in shared folders | Drive folder ID in client config |
| **Google Docs** | Create/update briefs and plans as collaborative Google Docs | None (available via MCP) |
| **Google Sheets** | Track content, performance, and revenue in shared spreadsheets (alternative to local CSVs) | Spreadsheet ID in client config |
| **Google Slides** | Generate client presentations, strategy decks, quarterly reviews | None (available via MCP) |
| **Typefully** | Create draft social posts for X and LinkedIn | API key as env var + `typefully-config.md` per client |

See the main `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for full integration details.

---

## Tips

1. **Be in the right directory** - Claude reads `.claude/CLAUDE.md` from your current location
2. **Client names are folder names** - Use the exact folder name (e.g., `acme-corp` not "Acme Corp")
3. **More context = better output** - Add notes about what's happening when you run weekly planning
4. **Review before accepting** - Claude will often propose changes; review them before confirming
5. **Keep tracking current** - The system works best with recent data in the CSVs

## Troubleshooting

**Claude doesn't know the client:**
- Make sure you're in the `ai-cmo/` directory
- Use the exact folder name from `clients/`

**Output is too generic:**
- Add more context to your prompt
- Make sure knowledge files are filled in
- Run `update whats working` if you have performance data

**Need to correct something:**
- Just tell Claude: "Actually, update that to [correction]"
- Or: "Edit [file] to change [x] to [y]"
