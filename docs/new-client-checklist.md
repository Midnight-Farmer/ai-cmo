## Common Onboarding Questions

**Q: What if the client doesn't have clear personas?**
A: Use the discovery call to create them together. Ask about their best customers and build from there.

**Q: What if they don't have performance history?**
A: Start whats-working.md with industry best practices and hypotheses. Update as you gather data.

**Q: How detailed should the StoryBrand be?**
A: At minimum: clear problem statement, guide positioning, and one-liner. Full framework is ideal.

**Q: What's the minimum viable onboarding?**
A: Complete: 00-client-overview.md, voice-guidelines.md, goals-and-benchmarks.md, and CLIENT-CLAUDE.md
